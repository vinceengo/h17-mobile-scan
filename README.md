## Installing
Once you have cloned the repository, you'll need to install dependencies to get the application running  :
To install Node.js dependencies
```
npm install
```

To install Bower dependencies
```
npm install -g bower
```
```
bower install
```

If you want to debug the application, I highly recommend you to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Here's the [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/runtimes/nodejs#_debugging-your-express-application) to set up your Visual Studio Code
